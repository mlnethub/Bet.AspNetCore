This library is designed only to be used with ASP.NET Core with Kestrel Applications, no proxies.

Pre-release packages are distributed via feedz.io `https://f.feedz.io/kdcllc/bet-aspnetcore/nuget/index.json`.

Account and Certificate information can be stored:

1. In Memory
2. Azure Storage

The case usage is with Azure Container Instances (ACIs) for a small sized websites

### LetsEncryptWeb

1. [`LetsEncryptWeb`](../LetsEncryptWeb/)


## Usage

```csharp
    services.AddLetsEncrypt(configure =>
    {
        var domainName = configuration.GetValue<string>("LetsEncryptDomainName");

        configure.Email = "email@domain.com";
        configure.HostNames = new[] { DomainName, "domain.com" };

        configure.UseStagingServer = true;

        configure.CertificateFriendlyName = DomainName;
        configure.CertificatePassword = "4a94dfd8-7ae1-4378-8eac-87a2b38b9087";

        configure.CertificateSigningRequest = new CsrInfo()
        {
            CountryName = "US",
            Organization = "KDCLLC",
            OrganizationUnit = "Dev",
            CommonName = DomainName
        };
    });
```

## Testing the Code

1. Install and run `ngrok http -bind-tls=false 5500`

2. Add the generated code to  `hosts file`

```txt
    127.0.0.1 TMP.ngrok.io
```

- Windows location     `C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts`
- OS/Linux `sudo vim /etc/hosts`

By default, certificates generated by Let's Encrypt's staging certificates will not appear as a trusted certificate.

## Future work

It would be beneficial to have the ability to:

1. Save to a fileshare
2. Wild card SSL certificates
3. CLI utility to generate SSL certificates based on DNS entries [Sample code](https://github.com/jwendl/keyvault-demo.git)
